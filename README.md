## Scope & Workback Schedule

### Mid July [5hrs] 
The deadline for getting something up is pretty firm--there is an event mid-July that will require the site being up. After that, the schedule is flexible. And the amount of content that is up mid-July is flexible too--so long as something is up.

- [ ] Launch to the public. Announce on Facebook and other social media. Anyone can find and visit protectoregonchildren.com

### Early July [10hrs] ~5hrs
Website is accessible at protectoregonchildren.com and accessible by a limited group for review and testing. During this 1-2 week period, small adjustments are expected. We'll test on iPhone5/6, an Android phone, a recent iPad and desktop versions of the latest IE, Safari, Chrome & Firefox.
- [ ] Base SEO setup, including analytics setup, metadata, social sharing previews.
- [ ] Donations can be made via PayPal — test transactions are made and verified.

### Wks 4/5 - End of June [20hrs] ~10hrs
- [ ] Visual Design Round 3 (if needed) and build-out.

- [ ] Hosting and social accounts are created: website hosting, domain name, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

### Wk 3 - June 15 [5hrs] ~5hrs
- [ ] Visual Design Round 2: We’ll share a new design for homepage & secondary page based on feedback from first round. Client shares your feedback.
- [ ] Client continues to work on content.

### Wk 2 - June 8 [5hrs] ~10hrs

- [ ] Client continues to work on content.

### Wk 1 - June 1 [15hrs] ~2hrs
- [ ] Visual Design Round 1: We’ll share 2-3 design comps for homepage (and possibly a secondary page)
- [ ] Content: We’ll share a clickable “wireframe” (un-themed Wordpress site) showcasing potential navigation and pages of content. Content will be “placeholder” where no real content yet exists. This will allow client to work on content as we work through visual designs. We’ll give client access to the content site, where client can add/edit and flesh out content as you create it.
